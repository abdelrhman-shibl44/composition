# Sass and Gulp.js Template
This project is a template built with Sass and Gulp.js. The purpose of this project is to learning Sass and Gulp.js

The template includes a simple HTML structure, as well as Sass files for styles and Gulp tasks for automating tasks such as compiling Sass, optimizing images, and serving the site locally. The styles are written in Sass using variables, mixins, and nesting, which makes it easier to write and maintain complex stylesheets.

To use this template, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies using npm install. Then, you can use Gulp.js to build the project and start a local server by running gulp. The compiled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files will be placed in the dist folder.

Additionally, this project demonstrates how to change the direction of the website's language from right-to-left (RTL) for Arabic to left-to-right (LTR) for English. The html tag in the index.html file has the dir attribute set to "rtl", which specifies that the text should be displayed from right to left. To change the direction to left-to-right, simply change the dir attribute to "ltr".
